Welcome to my program, quancirc. Thie simulator was mostly built as a way for me to improve my programming skills and also learn more
quantum information techniques and applications. The goal of this project is to not only implement a circuit that can simulate realistically
how quantum computers (atleast the ones we strive for, ie have all the gates) run, but also to create various other programs within, such as running
algorithms efficiently on the circuit, and also to create quantum cryptography protocols such as BB84 or QCF.

Here is some overall information, I try to docstring all functions, but this will give a little more indepth information on each class and also my thought process:
Bit class:
Qubit class:
Measure class:
Quant Info class:
Circuit class:
