Hi and welcome to my Quantum Computing Simulator! I am currently a masters student studying Theoretical Physics but have a passion for quantum computing and wanted to grasp a more fundamental understandings of quantum circuitry so made this. Also it helped me practice coding. Any feedback would be great! Please find a list of instructions below. P.S. This is still a work in progress

TODO: Revamp the whole program to focus around density matrices rather than qubits, this will allow for quantum channels to be implemented correctly and for mixed states to be used on the quantum circuit.

This is a repository for our Quantum Computing Project 


add Fourier transform to circuit
have a fast and slow implementation of Grovers to demonstrate speed up

comparing new for only one iteration for each, bare in mind the iterations scale linearly (for 1 oracle value, 24 is like 500 iterations, each like 10 seconds long)
