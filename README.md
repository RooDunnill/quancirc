Hi and welcome to my Quantum Computing Simulator! I am currently a masters student studying Theoretical Physics but have a passion for quantum computing and wanted to grasp a more fundamental understandings of quantum circuitry so made this. Also it helped me practice coding. Any feedback would be great! Please find a list of instructions below. P.S. This is still a work in progress

TODO: Revamp the whole program to focus around density matrices rather than qubits, this will allow for quantum channels to be implemented correctly and for mixed states to be used on the quantum circuit.

This is a repository for our Quantum Computing Project 


add Fourier transform to circuit
have a fast and slow implementation of Grovers to demonstrate speed up

comparing old and new

comparing new for only one iteration for each, bare in mind the iterations scale linearly (for 1 oracle value, 24 is like 500 iterations, each like 10 seconds long)

The limitation at this point is the prob dist, but i have also sped that up a lot now, ironically you need to classical search through every item in the list to find the highest probs, maybe we could implement grovers for the prob list XD
