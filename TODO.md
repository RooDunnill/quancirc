Coding:
  Implement Shannon and Von Neumann entropy functions for the qubits
  potentially make the density matrix a part of the class as self
  find a neat way to encorporate the density matrices more generally and a way to make mixed states
  produce a sorter to find the outcomes of grovers
  continue on Shors algorithm if people want to
  optimise the tensor product (matmul) and the matrix multiplication (mul)
