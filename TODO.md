Coding:
  Implement Shannon and Von Neumann entropy functions for the qubits
  potentially make the density matrix a part of the class as self
  find a neat way to encorporate the density matrices more generally and a way to make mixed states
  produce a sorter to find the outcomes of grovers
  continue on Shors algorithm if people want to
  optimise the tensor product (matmul) and the matrix multiplication (mul)

Department division:
  coding/programming part- Roo, Hayden, Sean (bridge)
  report/physics part- Siddhi, Gayathri, Boren (bridge)

Plan of action for week-5:
  optimising and improving Grovers algorithm,
  background study on Shors algorithm,
  meeting with Tony,
  continue onto cryptography if we want to
Roo Notes:
  Have completed Grover fully now, it is encapsualted within a class and can be run in many different functions.
  It is to the extent of my knowledge, efficient in the algorithm, the only thing that i think that could be improved is 
  lazy matrices.
  I have also made default gates and qubits and commented all of the code and am now working on a Density matrix class rather than a stand alone function
  After that I will move onto making a measurement class over a function that will allow every kind of measurement
  Then I will most likely create a Qubit generator that can create any single qubit in any state as well as Bell states
