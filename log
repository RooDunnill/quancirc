Roo: Refactored Measure and Density to be more readable and added Circuit
SeÃ¡n: Latex on Grovers
Week 6:
Roo: Refactored Grovers and added Quantum information measurements and also partial trace
Week 7:
Roo: Again refactored Grovers implementing FWHT and sped up most operations by implementing np.sum. Also added single gate addition to circuit
