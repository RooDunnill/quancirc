This is the meeting log on what everyone did this week:

Week 4: Before first meeting
Roo:Started working on basic code
Seán: compiled various notes on quantum algorithms and error correction and studied em
Week 5: 
Roo:Set up the github, added code, started Grovers algorithm
Seán: Studied Shor's and explained to group but decided too complicated
Week FLW:
Roo: Refactored Measure and Density to be more readable and added Circuit
Seán: Latex on Grovers
Week 6:
Roo: Refactored Grovers and added Quantum information measurements and also partial trace
Week 7:
Roo: Again refactored Grovers implementing FWHT and sped up most operations by implementing np.sum. Also added single gate addition to circuit
Week 8:
added many doc strings, have fixed a number of errors and also have added a noisy option to the quantum circuit, also made single qubit measurement and state collapse
