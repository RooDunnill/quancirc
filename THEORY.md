THEORY NOTES

Lie Algebras and Representations:
The state vectors of a quantum state are represented by SU(2)/U(1),
while the group that rotates these states is the U(2) Group.
For pure state rotations, the group is SU(2) which is a subgroup of U(2).
This is due to the fact that the unitary nature of the gates must be upheld
and SU(2) has determinant 1 from being a Special Unitary group. The manifold that
describes this is S^3 and is a 3 dimensional manifold, or has to be drawn on 4D.
The larger group U(2) represents every rotation within the bloch sphere, where anything
outside of SU(2) represents a change in the mixedness of the state. You can think fo SU(2)
as travelling along the manifold of the bloch sphere while U(2) not in SU(2) is any transformation
both along and through the manifold and into the infinite manifolds beneath it?
